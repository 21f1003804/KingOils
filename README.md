### 3. Set up Configuration

Create a `config.py` file in the root directory with the following content:

```python
# config.py

api_key = "xxxxxxxx"
api_secret = "xxxxxxxx"
login_url = "xxxxxxxx"
access_token = "xxxxxxxx"

TIMESCALE_DB_CONFIG = {
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "xxxxxxxx",
    "database": "xxxxxxxx",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
}
```

### 4. Run the Application

To start the trading engine and launch the live dashboard:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

- Begin real-time data ingestion and computation  
- Execute trades based on predefined strategy and risk rules  
- Store data in memory  
- Launch a live **Streamlit** dashboard hosted locally

## üìä Dashboard Access

Once running, the Streamlit dashboard will be available at:
